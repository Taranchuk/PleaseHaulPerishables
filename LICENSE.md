You are free to maintain, derive from, update, and re-upload the files contained herein. Yes, you can Github the source so everyone can see how janky my code is. ;)

You can monetise these mods in whatever way that Ludeon Studios currently allows. At time of writing, you were allowed to have a donation, Patreon, Ko-fi link, etc but not put mods behind a paywall. These things can change in future, so go and read up or ask someone who knows. If you work with another mod maker on these mods, make sure that they are credited and compensated appropriately for their work.

Guide

Please be consistent in how you release these mods. Whether you're going to update in place or make a new file on Steam, or whatever comes after Steam, when RimWorld updates to 1.1 through 1.99, make sure that the users know what to expect.

Please maintain these mods with love and care as if they were your own, and pass them on to someone else if you can no longer give them the attention they need.

Please keep in mind that compatibility with other mods is not always possible, or practical, when there are a dozen mods which do thing around the thing that you're trying to do. The most common comment I have on Steam Workshop is that "this mod doesn't work" and it's usually because of some other mod, or because of a lack of understanding about what the mod does, and that's not useful feedback.

Please use the included XCF files to make your own Steam thumbnail. Whether you want to leave my name on the thumbnail is up to you, but please at least use the RimWorld font so that the style stays consistent. Change up the backgrounds once in a while.

Please avoid feature bloat and keep the scope of the mods to what it should be. What this is varies from mod to mod.

For example, Sometimes Raids Go Wrong is quite specific in that it only makes raids go wrong, but very open in that you could have potentially limitless things go wrong with that raid.

For example, Things Go Wrong is open to possibly making any kind of 'pawns arrive' incident go wrong, and it was supposed to eventually allow other mod makers to write GoWrongs which would plug in and expand the possibilities. Never did get around to that. Maybe you can!



Regards,

Marvin
